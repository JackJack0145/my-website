        Purple and I have been quietly crafting something extraordinary with our VR game, 
        <strong>Mixed Taggers</strong>. While I take care of the technical side—designing immersive levels, 
        fine-tuning mechanics, and optimizing performance—Purple focuses on building our online presence. 
        Together, we even designed this very website to showcase our project and give you a glimpse into 
        our journey. Using his online nickname, Purple manages our Discord server and YouTube channel, 
        sharing sneak peeks and connecting with potential players. So far, only a few close friends know 
        about our ambitious project, but we dream big. One day, we hope all this hard work will make us 
        famous and successful. With my passion for creating games and Purple’s skills in community 
        building, we’re determined to make Mixed Taggers an unforgettable experience.
